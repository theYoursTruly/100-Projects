# E generator
Generating [Euler's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)) (e) is pretty straight forward. Formula is given so all we have to do is use it. For educational purposes, we won't be using math library for calculations (only to check the result).

**Note:** This is very simple program and it doesn't use any external libraries to store or display calculated value. Therefore, even if it's able to make calculations for a pretty much unlimited precision, it won't display anything past 50 characters and characters past 15 (or *sys.float_info.dig* to be exact) may be a little off.
